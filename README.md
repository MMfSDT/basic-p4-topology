# Basic P4 Topologies

The only working thing so far is `1s2h-1subnet.py`. Run it with `sudo python 1s2h-1subnet.py`.
The other `*.py` scripts in this directory are still being worked upon.

Make sure to have all P4-related tools and dependencies installed.
The `router/simple_router` executable was compiled in an Ubuntu 16.04 setup. 
If it does not work, try replacing it with your own compiled version.
